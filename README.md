# AED: Another text editor

AED is a text editor for the Agon platform (Agon light, Agon light2, Agon Origins, Console8).
It's screen navigation was inspired by various text editors I have used (notepad / nano / kate / vim) and
that inspiration drove the design and choices of navigation keys.

> NOTE: The editor uses most of the memory available, so do not start it if you are in BBCBasic.
